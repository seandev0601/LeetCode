# Problem
[1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary
](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-salary-excluding-the-minimum-and-maximum-salary/)


You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the ith employee.

Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]
Output: 2000.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000) / 1 = 2000
```

### Constraints:
```
3 <= salary.length <= 100
1000 <= salary[i] <= 106
All the integers of salary are unique.
```

## Solution

use heigher order function 
- [Reduce](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/reduce(_:_:))
- [Max](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/max())
- [Min](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/min())
- [removeAll(where:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/removeall(where:)-5k61r)

```swift
class Solution {
    func average(_ salary: [Int]) -> Double {
        let max = salary.max()
        let min = salary.min()
        
        var newSalary = salary
        newSalary.removeAll{$0 == max || $0 == min}
        
        let count = Double(newSalary.count)
        let sum: Double = Double(newSalary.reduce(0,+))
        return sum / count
    }
}
```
