# Problem
[1672.Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/)

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

 
### Example 1:
```
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

### Constraints:
```
m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100
```

## Solution

use heigher order function [Map](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/map(_:)-87c4d)、[Reduce](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/reduce(_:_:))、[Max](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/max())

```swift
class Solution {
    func maximumWealth(_ accounts: [[Int]]) -> Int {
        return accounts
        .map { 
            $0.reduce(0, +) 
        }
        .max()!
    }
}
