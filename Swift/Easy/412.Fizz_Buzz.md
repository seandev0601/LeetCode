# Problem
[412. Fizz Buzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/)

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
 ```

### Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 10^4
```

## Soulation

use heigher order function [Map](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/map(_:)-87c4d)、[Ternary operator](https://www.tutlane.com/tutorial/swift/swift-ternary-operator)

```swift 
class Solution {
    func fizzBuzz(_ n: Int) -> [String] {
        return (1...n).map {
            if $0 % 3 == 0 { return $0 % 5 == 0 ? "FizzBuzz" : "Fizz" }
            if $0 % 5 == 0 { return "Buzz" }
            return "\($0)"
        }
    }
}
